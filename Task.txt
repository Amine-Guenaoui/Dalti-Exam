Task Description
Objective

Create a service for the booking system project using PostgreSQL, and implement functionalities to modify and update the service. The service should have at least a datatable for the services and show all the necessary data.
Tasks

    Set up PostgreSQL Database (1 hour)
        Install and configure PostgreSQL.
        Create a database for the project.

    Create Service Model and Migration (1 hour)
        Define the Service model with necessary attributes (e.g., service name, description, price).
        Create a migration file to set up the services table in the database.
        Run the migration to create the table.

    Create Service Controller and Routes (1 hour)
        Set up the controller for handling service-related operations.
        Define routes for creating, updating, and showing services.

    Implement Service Creation and Update Functionality (2 hours)
        Implement the logic for creating new services in the controller.
        Implement the logic for updating existing services in the controller.
        Validate input data and handle errors.

    Implement Service Retrieval Functionality (1 hour)
        Implement the logic for retrieving and displaying all services.
        Ensure necessary data is visible (e.g., service name, description, price).

    Create Simple Views for Services (1.5 hours)
        Design and implement simple views for creating, updating, and listing services.
        Ensure views are user-friendly and functional.

    Test the Service Endpoints (1.5 hours)
        Write and run basic tests for service creation, update, and retrieval endpoints.
        Ensure all functionality works correctly.

Total Estimated Time: 8 hours
